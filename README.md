# Test-5 Question-1
Create a Student Marks Display System. This application can be developed in any one or more of the technologies from the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). There will be 2 screens (pages) for this application.

Screen 1 → This screen will be used by educators to enter the student name and their marks. Your page should have these 2 input fields at least and should have a submit button to send the data to your backend and store in the Database.

Screen 2→ This screen will be used by the students to see their marks. On this screen, you are supposed to show a table containing the data of name and marks which was entered by the educators. You will need to fetch this data from the backend which will be connected to the database.

You can have a navigation bar at the top to allow routing between these pages. Additional functionalities in terms of logic and User Interface will be rewarded if implemented properly
